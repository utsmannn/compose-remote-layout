## Implementation Approach

### Why Custom Nodes?

Rather than building animations into the core library, this proposal uses the existing **Custom Nodes** system:

✅ **Zero Breaking Changes** - Uses existing extension points
✅ **Backward Compatible** - Doesn't modify core library
✅ **Maximum Flexibility** - Apps implement exactly what they need
✅ **Minimal Maintenance** - Leverages standard Compose APIs
✅ **Easy Adoption** - Can be added incrementally

### How It Works

1. **Register Custom Nodes** (one-time setup):
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    AnimationNodes.registerAll()
}
```

2. **Define in JSON**:
```json
{
  "animated_visibility": {
    "visible": "{isExpanded}",
    "enterType": "expandVertically",
    "exitType": "shrinkVertically",
    "children": [...]
  }
}
```

3. **Control from Code**:
```kotlin
bindsValue.setValue("isExpanded", "true") // Triggers animation
```

## Features Supported

### AnimatedVisibility
- ✅ Fade in/out
- ✅ Slide (horizontal/vertical)
- ✅ Expand/shrink
- ✅ Scale in/out
- ✅ Configurable duration, delay, easing
- ✅ Combined enter/exit animations

### AnimatedContent
- ✅ State-based content transitions
- ✅ Fade transitions
- ✅ Slide transitions (all directions)
- ✅ Scale transitions
- ✅ Custom combined transitions

### Animated Modifiers
- ✅ Content size animation
- ✅ Background color animation
- ✅ Configurable duration and easing

## Benefits

1. **Server-Driven Animations** 🌐
   - Update animation behavior without app deployment
   - A/B test different animation styles
   - Customize per user or segment

2. **Consistent UX** 🎨
   - Define animations once, use everywhere
   - Maintain animation consistency across platforms
   - Easy to update animation guidelines

3. **Reduced App Size** 📦
   - No need for multiple animation variations
   - Only include animations you use
   - Optimize for each platform

4. **Easier Iteration** 🔄
   - Designers can tweak animations remotely
   - No code changes needed
   - Faster iteration cycles

5. **Developer-Friendly** 👩‍💻
   - Clear documentation and examples
   - Copy-paste ready code
   - Extensible for custom needs

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Expandable FAQ
```json
{
  "column": {
    "children": [
      {
        "button": {
          "content": "What is this?",
          "clickId": "toggle_faq"
        }
      },
      {
        "animated_visibility": {
          "visible": "{faqExpanded}",
          "enterType": "expandVertically",
          "exitType": "shrinkVertically",
          "children": [
            {
              "text": {
                "content": "This is an expandable answer!"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Tab Navigation
```json
{
  "animated_content": {
    "targetState": "{currentTab}",
    "transitionSpec": {
      "type": "slideInOut",
      "direction": "left"
    },
    "content": {
      "home": { "text": { "content": "Home" } },
      "profile": { "text": { "content": "Profile" } }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Loading States
```json
{
  "animated_visibility": {
    "visible": "{isLoading}",
    "enter": { "type": "fadeIn" },
    "exit": { "type": "fadeOut" },
    "children": [
      { "text": { "content": "Loading..." } }
    ]
  }
}
```
